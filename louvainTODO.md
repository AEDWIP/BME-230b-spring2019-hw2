# Louvain TODO

## input format
- input will be from anndata object
- knn_to_graphModule.py has code convert to igraph
- challenge how are we going to pass this back so that scanpy.pl.louvain can use it
    * [scanpy.tl.louvain](https://icb-scanpy.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/api/scanpy.tl.louvain.html#scanpy.tl.louvain)
    * from man page
        ```
        Returns
None
By default (copy=False), updates adata with the following fields:

AnnData

## Assumptions
1. edges are weighted
2. graph is undirected
3. no self loops
4. only a single edge between a given pair of vertexs
    a. if you have multiple edges, model them as a single edge with a combined weight
